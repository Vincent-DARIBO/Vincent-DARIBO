###  Hi ! I'm Vincent ðŸ‘‹


ðŸŽ“ I am currently studying at Epitech Lyon where I am learning to become a professional and efficient software developper.

Some projects I'm proud of:

- [Tous chez Marcel](https://github.com/TousChezMarcel/TousChezMarcel): *Currently working on*. This project is a part of my cursus at Epitech where we are supposed to find a solution to a social, environemental or ecologic issue. The goal of Tous chez Marcel is to encourage sharing between senior and young citizen throught various activities and house sharing.
- [RN-training-app](https://github.com/Vincent-DARIBO/React-Native-training-app): A small app made after my internship at [Advantys](https://www.linkedin.com/company/advantys/) to summarize all technical skills acquired.
- [Recepies workshop](https://github.com/Vincent-DARIBO/Workshop-recipes-app-rn): A workshop to teach the basics of React Native at school.
