###  Welcome to my github account ! 👋


🎓 I am currently studying at Epitech Lyon where I am learning to become a professional and efficient software developper.

Some projects I'm proud of:

[RN-trainee-app](https://github.com/Vincent-DARIBO/React-Native-training-app): A small app made after my internship at [Advantys](https://www.linkedin.com/company/advantys/) to summarize all technical skills acquired.
